                <p>To answer that question, let's ask a few more:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Do you have a product, service, or message you want to offer others?</li>
          <li>Are you too successful without a site that you can afford to turn away business</li></ul>
        <p>If the answer to these are yes and no, respectively, then you probably need a website that will help you:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>communicate with others, telling your story and letting others know about your and your offerings.</li>
          <li>build a following or community.</li>
          <li>become more successful in your efforts at a relatively low cost and reaching more people than you could through any other medium.</li></ul>

                 <p>I'm big on usability and accessibility, and you'll hear me rant and rave about how your site needs to be both.</p>
        <p>Think of it this way. What good is your investment (and yes, it is an investment) in your website if you simply irritate visitors by not making it as usable as possible? Would you purposely build walls where doors should be in your office or store? Would you put up gates deterring shoppers or clients?</p>
        <p>Ensuring a usable site will pay off by allowing visitors to accomplish their goals--their reason for coming to your site--and help you accomplish your goals in building the site. It's a win-win situation!</p>

                <p>That depends on a lot of things.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Is your site written in such a way that visitors want to purchase your services or goods?</li>
          <li>Is it easy for visitors to make a purchase or contact you to arrange for services?</li>
          <li>Is your site more attractive, easier to use, or offering something unique to attract buyers?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Making sure your content is written for the right audience, optimized for web (it's a different language and style than print), and that your offerings are clear and enticing will go a long way toward paying for your investment and more.</p>
